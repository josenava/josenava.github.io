      <description>DISCLAIMER: I am not expecting more than 100 concurrent requests, so I believe I don&amp;rsquo;t need everything a VPS can offer. I owned a VPS with OVH which was extended yearly since 2015. As the time to renew it again was approaching this year, I decided to cancel my contract and stop renewing the VPS as the only usage I was giving to it was hosting a small blog with no visits which I created to learn a little bit about Wordpress.</description>
